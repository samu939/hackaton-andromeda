# Gemini API Configuration
# Get your API key from: https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here

# Note: For Angular applications, environment variables are set at build time
# You need to add your API key directly in the environment files:
# - src/environments/environment.ts (for development)
# - src/environments/environment.prod.ts (for production)
